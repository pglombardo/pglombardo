# What I'm Building

I'm the founder of [Apnotic](https://apnotic.com) - a bootstrapped, privately held company focused on secure information distribution.

We build [Password Pusher](https://pwpush.com), a platform used by thousands of organizations to securely distribute passwords, files and sensitive data.


I also build [HiveMQtt](https://hivemq.github.io/hivemq-mqtt-client-dotnet/) and run [Awesome MQTT](https://awesome-mqtt.com) - a curated collection of MQTT brokers, tools, libraries and resources.

# Open Source

## Password Pusher

[![Password Pusher](./assets/pwpush-horizontal-logo.png)](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher)

Since 2011, I've built and maintained Password Pusher - a secure platform for sharing sensitive information with self-destructing links and full audit trails. Trusted by thousands of companies worldwide.

**By the numbers:**
- **100M+** secrets securely shared
- **345k+** monthly active users at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com)
- **15+** years in production
- **31+** language translations
- **99.99%** historical uptime

The platform features AES-256 encryption, automatic expiration, passphrase protection, team collaboration and a powerful API. Available as a hosted SaaS (US & EU regions) or fully self-hosted via Docker/Kubernetes. White-label ready with 26 bundled themes.

## MQTT

I also build and maintain [HiveMQtt](https://hivemq.github.io/hivemq-mqtt-client-dotnet/) - the official C# MQTT client for .NET by [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/). It's fully MQTT 5.0 compliant and designed for enterprise-grade IoT deployments.

Features include async/await patterns, TLS/SSL security, WebSocket support and compatibility with .NET 6, 7, 8 and 9.

I also curate [Awesome MQTT](https://awesome-mqtt.com) - a collection of MQTT resources, brokers, tools and libraries.
